Running the AWSAndroidDemoTVMIdentity Sample
============================================
This sample demonstrates interaction with the IdentityTVM.  The IdentityTVM requires the user to register with the 
App by first connecting to an external website and provide a username and password.  The username and username will 
then be required to log into the sample App.  In this sample the registration website is a specific page on the 
IdentityTVM.
