     * <p>

     * <code>SetDesiredCapacity</code> changes the size of your Auto Scaling
     * group without regard to the cooldown period. This could be useful, for
     * example, if Auto Scaling did something unexpected for some reason. If
     * your cooldown period is 10 minutes, Auto Scaling would normally reject
     * requests to change the size of the group for that entire 10 minute
     * period. The <code>SetDesiredCapacity</code> command allows you to
     * circumvent this restriction and change the size of the group before
     * the end of the cooldown period.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * In the second case, if you write your own triggering system, you can
     * use <code>SetDesiredCapacity</code> to control the size of your Auto
     * Scaling group. If you want the same cooldown functionality that Auto
     * Scaling offers, you can configure <code>SetDesiredCapacity</code> to
     * honor cooldown by setting the <code>HonorCooldown</code> parameter to
     * <code>true</code> .
