/**
 * <p>
 * There are two primary Auto Scaling process types--
 * <code>Launch</code> and <code>Terminate</code> . The
 * <code>Launch</code> process creates a new Amazon EC2 instance for an
 * Auto Scaling group, and the <code>Terminate</code> process removes an
 * existing Amazon EC2 instance.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The remaining Auto Scaling process types relate to specific Auto
 * Scaling features:
 * <ul>
 * <li>AddToLoadBalancer</li>
 * <li>AlarmNotifications</li>
 * <li>AZRebalance</li>
 * <li>HealthCheck</li>
 * <li>ReplaceUnhealthy</li>
 * <li>ScheduledActions</li>
 * 
 * </ul>
 * 
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>IMPORTANT:</b> If you suspend Launch or Terminate, all other
 * process types are affected to varying degrees. The following
 * descriptions discuss how each process type is affected by a suspension
 * of Launch or Terminate.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The <code>AddToLoadBalancer</code> process type adds instances to the
 * the load balancer when the instances are launched. If you suspend this
 * process, Auto Scaling will launch the instances but will not add them
 * to the load balancer. If you resume the <code>AddToLoadBalancer</code>
 * process, Auto Scaling will also resume adding new instances to the
 * load balancer when they are launched. However, Auto Scaling will not
 * add running instances that were launched when the process was
 * suspended.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The <code>AlarmNotifications</code> process type accepts
 * notifications from Amazon CloudWatch alarms that are associated with
 * the Auto Scaling group. If you suspend the
 * <code>AlarmNotifications</code> process type, Auto Scaling will not
 * automatically execute scaling policies that would be triggered by
 * alarms.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Although the <code>AlarmNotifications</code> process type is not
 * directly affected by a suspension of <code>Launch</code> or
 * <code>Terminate</code> ,
 * alarm notifications are often used to signal that a change
 * in the size of the Auto Scaling group is warranted. If you suspend
 * <code>Launch</code> or <code>Terminate</code> , Auto Scaling might not
 * be able to implement the alarm's associated policy.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The <code>AZRebalance</code> process type seeks to maintain a
 * balanced number of instances across Availability Zones within a
 * Region. If you remove an Availability Zone from your Auto Scaling
 * group or an Availability Zone otherwise becomes unhealthy or
 * unavailable, Auto Scaling launches new instances in an unaffected
 * Availability Zone before terminating the unhealthy or unavailable
 * instances. When the unhealthy Availability Zone returns to a healthy
 * state, Auto Scaling automatically redistributes the application
 * instances evenly across all of the designated Availability Zones.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>IMPORTANT:</b> If you call SuspendProcesses on the launch process
 * type, the AZRebalance process will neither launch new instances nor
 * terminate existing instances. This is because the AZRebalance process
 * terminates existing instances only after launching the replacement
 * instances. If you call SuspendProcesses on the terminate process type,
 * the AZRebalance process can cause your Auto Scaling group to grow up
 * to ten percent larger than the maximum size. This is because Auto
 * Scaling allows groups to temporarily grow larger than the maximum size
 * during rebalancing activities. If Auto Scaling cannot terminate
 * instances, your Auto Scaling group could remain up to ten percent
 * larger than the maximum size until you resume the terminate process
 * type.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The <code>HealthCheck</code> process type checks the health of the
 * instances. Auto Scaling marks an instance as unhealthy if Amazon EC2
 * or Elastic Load Balancing informs Auto Scaling that the instance is
 * unhealthy. The <code>HealthCheck</code> process can override the
 * health status of an instance that you set with SetInstanceHealth.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The <code>ReplaceUnhealthy</code> process type terminates instances
 * that are marked as unhealthy and subsequently creates new instances to
 * replace them. This process calls both of the primary process
 * types--first <code>Terminate</code> and then <code>Launch</code> .
 * 
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>IMPORTANT:</b> The HealthCheck process type works in conjunction
 * with the ReplaceUnhealthly process type to provide health check
 * functionality. If you suspend either Launch or Terminate, the
 * ReplaceUnhealthy process type will not function properly.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The <code>ScheduledActions</code> process type performs scheduled
 * actions that you create with PutScheduledUpdateGroupAction. Scheduled
 * actions often involve launching new instances or terminating existing
 * instances. If you suspend either <code>Launch</code> or
 * <code>Terminate</code> , your scheduled actions might not function as
 * expected.
 * </p>
