/**
 * Interface for accessing AmazonEC2.
 * Amazon EC2 <p>
 * Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that
 * provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to
 * make web-scale computing easier for developers.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Amazon EC2's simple web service interface allows you to obtain and
 * configure capacity with minimal friction. It provides you with
 * complete control of your computing resources and lets you run on
 * Amazon's proven computing environment. Amazon EC2 reduces the time
 * required to obtain and boot new server instances to minutes, allowing
 * you to quickly scale capacity, both up and down, as your computing
 * requirements change. Amazon EC2 changes the economics of computing by
 * allowing you to pay only for capacity that you actually use. Amazon
 * EC2 provides developers the tools to build failure resilient
 * applications and isolate themselves from common failure scenarios.
 * </p>

     * possible to satisfy the requested maximum values.
     * </p>

     * You can provide an optional key pair ID for each image in the launch
     * request (for more information, see CreateKeyPair). All instances that
     * are created from images that use this key pair will have access to the
     * associated public key at boot. You can use this key to provide secure
     * access to an instance of an image on a per-instance basis. Amazon EC2
     * public images use this feature to provide secure access without
     * passwords.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * <b>IMPORTANT:</b> Launching public images without a key pair ID will
     * leave them inaccessible. The public key material is made available to
     * the instance at boot time by placing it in the openssh_id.pub file on
     * a logical device that is exposed to the instance as /dev/sda2 (the
     * ephemeral store). The format of this file is suitable for use as an
     * entry within ~/.ssh/authorized_keys (the OpenSSH format). This can be
     * done at boot (e.g., as part of rc.local) allowing for secure access
     * without passwords. Optional user data can be provided in the launch
     * request. All instances that collectively comprise the launch request
     * have access to this data For more information, see Instance Metadata.
