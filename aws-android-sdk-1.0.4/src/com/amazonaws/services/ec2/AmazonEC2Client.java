 * Amazon EC2 <p>
 * Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that
 * provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to
 * make web-scale computing easier for developers.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Amazon EC2's simple web service interface allows you to obtain and
 * configure capacity with minimal friction. It provides you with
 * complete control of your computing resources and lets you run on
 * Amazon's proven computing environment. Amazon EC2 reduces the time
 * required to obtain and boot new server instances to minutes, allowing
 * you to quickly scale capacity, both up and down, as your computing
 * requirements change. Amazon EC2 changes the economics of computing by
 * allowing you to pay only for capacity that you actually use. Amazon
 * EC2 provides developers the tools to build failure resilient
 * applications and isolate themselves from common failure scenarios.

     * have access to this data For more information, see Instance Metadata.

     * You can filter the results to return information only about Spot
     * Instance requests that match criteria you specify. For example, you
     * could get information about requests where the Spot Price you
     * specified is a certain value (you can't use greater than or less than
     * comparison, but you can use <code>*</code> and <code>?</code>
     * wildcards). You can specify multiple values for a filter. A Spot
     * Instance request must match at least one of the specified values for
     * it to be included in the results.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * You can specify multiple filters (e.g., the Spot Price is equal to a
     * particular value, and the instance type is <code>m1.small</code> ).
     * The result includes information for a particular request only if it
     * matches all your filters. If there's no match, no special message is
     * returned; the response is simply empty.

     * <p>
     * You can use wildcards with the filter values: an asterisk matches
     * zero or more characters, and <code>?</code> matches exactly one
