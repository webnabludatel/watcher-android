/**
 * Container for the parameters to the {@link com.amazonaws.services.ec2.AmazonEC2#describeImages(DescribeImagesRequest) DescribeImages operation}.
 * <p>
 * The DescribeImages operation returns information about AMIs, AKIs,
 * and ARIs available to the user. Information returned includes image
 * type, product codes, architecture, and kernel and RAM disk IDs. Images
 * available to the user include public images available for any user to
 * launch, private images owned by the user making the request, and
 * private images owned by other users for which the user has explicit
 * launch permissions.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Launch permissions fall into three categories:
 * </p>
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li> <b>Public:</b> The owner of the AMI granted launch permissions
 * for the AMI to the all group. All users have launch permissions for
 * these AMIs. </li>
 * <li> <b>Explicit:</b> The owner of the AMI granted launch permissions
 * to a specific user. </li>
 * <li> <b>Implicit:</b> A user has implicit launch permissions for all
 * AMIs he or she owns. </li>
 * 
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The list of AMIs returned can be modified by specifying AMI IDs, AMI
 * owners, or users with launch permissions. If no options are specified,
 * Amazon EC2 returns all AMIs for which the user has launch permissions.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If you specify one or more AMI IDs, only AMIs that have the specified
 * IDs are returned. If you specify an invalid AMI ID, a fault is
 * returned. If you specify an AMI ID for which you do not have access,
 * it will not be included in the returned results.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If you specify one or more AMI owners, only AMIs from the specified
 * owners and for which you have access are returned. The results can
 * include the account IDs of the specified owners, amazon for AMIs owned
 * by Amazon or self for AMIs that you own.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If you specify a list of executable users, only users that have
 * launch permissions for the AMIs are returned. You can specify account
 * IDs (if you own the AMI(s)), self for AMIs for which you own or have
 * explicit permissions, or all for public AMIs.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>NOTE:</b> Deregistered images are included in the returned results
 * for an unspecified interval after deregistration.
 * </p>
