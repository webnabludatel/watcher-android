 * Stops an instance that uses an Amazon EBS volume as its root device.
 * Instances that use Amazon EBS volumes as their root devices can be
 * quickly stopped and started. When an instance is stopped, the compute
 * resources are released and you are not billed for hourly instance
 * usage. However, your root partition Amazon EBS volume remains,
 * continues to persist your data, and you are charged for Amazon EBS
 * volume usage. You can restart your instance at any time.

 * <b>NOTE:</b> Before stopping an instance, make sure it is in a state
 * from which it can be restarted. Stopping an instance does not preserve
 * data stored in RAM. Performing this operation on an instance that uses
 * an instance store as its root device returns an error.
