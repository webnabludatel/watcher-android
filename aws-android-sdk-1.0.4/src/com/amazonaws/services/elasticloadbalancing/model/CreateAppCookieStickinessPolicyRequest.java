/**
 * Container for the parameters to the {@link com.amazonaws.services.elasticloadbalancing.AmazonElasticLoadBalancing#createAppCookieStickinessPolicy(CreateAppCookieStickinessPolicyRequest) CreateAppCookieStickinessPolicy operation}.
 * <p>
 * Generates a stickiness policy with sticky session lifetimes that
 * follow that of an application-generated cookie. This policy can be
 * associated only with HTTP/HTTPS listeners.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This policy is similar to the policy created by
 * CreateLBCookieStickinessPolicy, except that the lifetime of the
 * special Elastic Load Balancing cookie follows the lifetime of the
 * application-generated cookie specified in the policy configuration.
 * The LoadBalancer only inserts a new stickiness cookie when the
 * application response includes a new application cookie.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If the application cookie is explicitly removed or expires, the
 * session stops being sticky until a new application cookie is issued.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>NOTE:</b> An application client must receive and send two cookies:
 * the application-generated cookie and the special Elastic Load
 * Balancing cookie named AWSELB. This is the default behavior for many
 * common web browsers.
 * </p>
