/**
 * Container for the parameters to the {@link com.amazonaws.services.elasticloadbalancing.AmazonElasticLoadBalancing#createLBCookieStickinessPolicy(CreateLBCookieStickinessPolicyRequest) CreateLBCookieStickinessPolicy operation}.
 * <p>
 * Generates a stickiness policy with sticky session lifetimes
 * controlled by the lifetime of the browser (user-agent) or a specified
 * expiration period. This policy can be associated only with HTTP/HTTPS
 * listeners.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When a LoadBalancer implements this policy, the LoadBalancer uses a
 * special cookie to track the backend server instance for each request.
 * When the LoadBalancer receives a request, it first checks to see if
 * this cookie is present in the request. If so, the LoadBalancer sends
 * the request to the application server specified in the cookie. If not,
 * the LoadBalancer sends the request to a server that is chosen based on
 * the existing load balancing algorithm.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A cookie is inserted into the response for binding subsequent
 * requests from the same user to that server. The validity of the cookie
 * is based on the cookie expiration time, which is specified in the
 * policy configuration.
