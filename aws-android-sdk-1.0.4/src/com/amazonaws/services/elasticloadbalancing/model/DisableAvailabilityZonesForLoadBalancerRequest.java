/**

 * Removes the specified EC2 Availability Zones from the set of
 * configured Availability Zones for the LoadBalancer.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * There must be at least one Availability Zone registered with a
 * LoadBalancer at all times. A client cannot remove all the Availability
 * Zones from a LoadBalancer. Once an Availability Zone is removed, all
 * the instances registered with the LoadBalancer that are in the removed
 * Availability Zone go into the OutOfService state. Upon Availability
 * Zone removal, the LoadBalancer attempts to equally balance the traffic
 * among its remaining usable Availability Zones. Trying to remove an
 * Availability Zone that was not associated with the LoadBalancer does
 * nothing.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>NOTE:</b> In order for this call to be successful, the client must
 * have created the LoadBalancer. The client must provide the same
 * account credentials as those that were used to create the
 * LoadBalancer.
