/**
 * Represents an e-mail grantee.  An e-mail grantee is a grantee 
 * identified by their e-mail
 * address and authenticated by an Amazon system.
 * <p>
 * E-mail grants are internally converted to the canonical user representation
 * when creating the ACL. If the grantee changes their e-mail address, it
 * will not affect existing Amazon S3 permissions.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Adding a grantee by e-mail address only works if exactly one Amazon account
 * corresponds to the specified e-mail address. If multiple Amazon accounts are
 * associated with the e-mail address, an <code>AmbiguousGrantByEmail</code> 
 * error message is
 * returned. This happens rarely, but usually occurs if a user created 
 * an Amazon account
 * in the past, forgotten the password, and created another Amazon account using
 * the same e-mail address. If this occurs, the user should contact Amazon 
 * customer service to have the accounts merged.
 * Alernatively, grant user access
 * specifying the canonical user representation.
