/**
 * High level utility for managing transfers to Amazon S3.
 * <p>
 * <code>TransferManager</code> provides a simple API for uploading content to
 * Amazon S3, and makes extensive use of Amazon S3 multipart uploads to achieve
 * enhanced throughput, performance and reliability.
 * <p>
 * When possible, <code>TransferManager</code> attempts to use multiple threads
 * to upload multiple parts of a single upload at once. When dealing with large
 * content sizes and high bandwidth, this can have a significant increase on
 * throughput.
 * <p>
 * <code>TransferManager</code> is responsible for managing resources such as
 * connections and threads; share a single instance of
 * <code>TransferManager</code> whenever possible. <code>TransferManager</code>,
 * like all the client classes in the AWS SDK for Java, is thread safe.
 * <p>
 * Using <code>TransferManager</code> to upload options to Amazon S3 is easy:
 *
 * <pre>
 * AWSCredentials myCredentials = new BasicAWSCredentials(...);
 * TransferManager tx = new TransferManager(myCredentials);
 * Upload myUpload = tx.upload(myBucket, myFile.getName(), myFile);
 *
 * while (myUpload.isDone() == false) {
 *     System.out.println("Transfer: " + myUpload.getDescription());
 *     System.out.println("  - State: " + myUpload.getState());
 *     System.out.println("  - Progress: " + myUpload.getProgress().getBytesTransfered());
 *     // Do work while we wait for our upload to complete...
 *     Thread.sleep(500);
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Note: Transfers are stored in memory. If the JVM is restarted, previous
 * transfers are no longer accessible. If needed, clean up any multipart uploads
 * that are incomplete.
