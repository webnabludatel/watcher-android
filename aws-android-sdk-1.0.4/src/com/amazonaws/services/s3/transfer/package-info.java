/**
 * Transfer management.
 * <p>
 * This package provides the {@link com.amazonaws.services.s3.transfer.TransferManager} class, which
 * manages a queue of asynchronous transfers.  Callers can create a TransferManager instance, sharing
 * that same instance throughout their application, queue new uploads for TransferManager to process,
 * and continue working while TransferManager tracks the asynchronous upload progress.
 * <p>
 * The main benefits of using TransferManager are:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Simplified API for working with, querying, and manipulating transfers.
 *   <li>Consistent interface for submitting uploads that abstracts the single part and multipart upload logic.
 *   <li>Increased throughput when multiple parts of an upload can be uploaded to Amazon S3 in parallel.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The AmazonS3TransferProgress sample included in the AWS SDK for Java demonstrates how to use
 * TransferManager and how to track progress for uploads.
 * <p>
 * Using TransferManager to upload data to Amazon S3 is easy:
 * <pre>
 * AWSCredentials myCredentials = new BasicAWSCredentials(...);
 * TransferManager tm = new TransferManager(myCredentials);
 * Transfer myUpload = tm.upload(myBucket, myFile.getName(), myFile);
 *
 * // You can keep doing work while the transfer uploads in a background thread
 * while (myUpload.isDone() == false) {
 *     System.out.println("Transfer: " + myUpload.getDescription());
 *     System.out.println("  - State:    " + myUpload.getState());
 *     System.out.println("  - Progress: " + myUpload.getProgress().getBytesTransfered());
 *     // Do work while we wait for our upload to complete...
 *     Thread.sleep(500);
 * }
 *
 * // Or you can wait for the transfer to finish if you don't need to do more work
 * myUpload.waitForCompletion();
 * </pre>
 *
