/**
 * Interface for accessing AmazonSQS.
 * Amazon Simple Queue Service <p>
 * Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) offers a reliable, highly
 * scalable, hosted queue for storing messages as they travel between
 * computers. By using Amazon SQS, developers can simply move data
 * between distributed components of their applications that perform
 * different tasks, without losing messages or requiring each component
 * to be always available. Amazon SQS makes it easy to build an automated
 * workflow, working in close conjunction with the Amazon Elastic Compute
 * Cloud (Amazon EC2) and the other AWS infrastructure web services.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Amazon SQS works by exposing Amazon's web-scale messaging
 * infrastructure as a web service. Any computer on the Internet can add
 * or read messages without any installed software or special firewall
 * configurations. Components of applications using Amazon SQS can run
 * independently, and do not need to be on the same network, developed
 * with the same technologies, or running at the same time.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Visit <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/sqs/"> http://aws.amazon.com/sqs/

     * <p>
     * The <code>ChangeMessageVisibility</code> action changes the visibility
     * timeout of a specified message in a queue to a new value. The maximum
     * allowed timeout value you can set the value to is 12 hours. This means
     * you can't extend the timeout of a message in an existing queue to more
     * than a total visibility timeout of 12 hours. (For more information
     * visibility timeout, see <a
     * ices.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/AboutVT.html">
     * Visibility Timeout </a> in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide.)
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * For example, let's say you have a message and its default message
     * visibility timeout is 30 minutes. You could call
     * <code>ChangeMessageVisiblity</code> with a value of two hours and the
     * effective timeout would be two hours and 30 minutes. When that time
     * comes near you could again extend the time out by calling
     * ChangeMessageVisiblity, but this time the maximum allowed timeout
     * would be 9 hours and 30 minutes.

     * <b>IMPORTANT:</b>Unlike with a queue, when you change the visibility
     * timeout for a specific message, that timeout value is applied
