/**
 * Container for the parameters to the {@link com.amazonaws.services.sqs.AmazonSQS#changeMessageVisibility(ChangeMessageVisibilityRequest) ChangeMessageVisibility operation}.
 * <p>
 * The <code>ChangeMessageVisibility</code> action changes the visibility
 * timeout of a specified message in a queue to a new value. The maximum
 * allowed timeout value you can set the value to is 12 hours. This means
 * you can't extend the timeout of a message in an existing queue to more
 * than a total visibility timeout of 12 hours. (For more information
 * visibility timeout, see <a
 * ices.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/AboutVT.html">
 * Visibility Timeout </a> in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide.)
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For example, let's say you have a message and its default message
 * visibility timeout is 30 minutes. You could call
 * <code>ChangeMessageVisiblity</code> with a value of two hours and the
 * effective timeout would be two hours and 30 minutes. When that time
 * comes near you could again extend the time out by calling
 * ChangeMessageVisiblity, but this time the maximum allowed timeout
 * would be 9 hours and 30 minutes.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>IMPORTANT:</b>If you attempt to set the VisibilityTimeout to an
 * amount more than the maximum time left, Amazon SQS returns an error.
 * It will not automatically recalculate and increase the timeout to the
 * maximum time remaining.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>IMPORTANT:</b>Unlike with a queue, when you change the visibility
 * timeout for a specific message, that timeout value is applied
 * immediately but is not saved in memory for that message. If you don't
 * delete a message after it is received, the visibility timeout for the
 * message the next time it is received reverts to the original timeout
 * value, not the value you set with the ChangeMessageVisibility action.
 * </p>
