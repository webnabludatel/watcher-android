/**
 * Synchronous and asynchronous client classes for accessing AmazonSQS.
 *
 * Amazon Simple Queue Service <p>
 * Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) offers a reliable, highly
 * scalable, hosted queue for storing messages as they travel between
 * computers. By using Amazon SQS, developers can simply move data
 * between distributed components of their applications that perform
 * different tasks, without losing messages or requiring each component
 * to be always available. Amazon SQS makes it easy to build an automated
 * workflow, working in close conjunction with the Amazon Elastic Compute
 * Cloud (Amazon EC2) and the other AWS infrastructure web services.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Amazon SQS works by exposing Amazon's web-scale messaging
 * infrastructure as a web service. Any computer on the Internet can add
 * or read messages without any installed software or special firewall
 * configurations. Components of applications using Amazon SQS can run
 * independently, and do not need to be on the same network, developed
 * with the same technologies, or running at the same time.
 * </p>
