JavaTM API for XML Processing
README

Specification Version: 1.4
Reference Implementation (RI) Version: 1.4.3

The Java API for XML Processing (JAXP) enables applications to parse,
transform, validate and query XML documents using an API that is
independent of any particular XML processor implementation. JAXP
provides a pluggability layer to enable vendors to provide their own
implementations without introducing dependencies in application code.
Using this software, application and tool developers can build
fully-functional XML-enabled Java applications for e-commerce,
application integration, and web publishing.

The Java Platform, Standard Edition version 6.0 includes JAXP
1.4. JAXP 1.4 is a maintenance release of JAXP 1.3 with support for
the Streaming API for XML (StAX).  JAXP 1.4 FCS was released on
Oct. 31, 2006 with a code base the same as that in JDK 6.0. JAXP 1.4.3
adds many changes/bug fixes as listed in the change log.  For
information about the current development activities, please refer to
the JAXP project on Java.net.
